# Font Awesome 6 Site Scraper

**Simple scraping script to get icons and their category from fontawesome.com**
Used to create category files for Font Awesome Gallery, a vscode extension that allows you to view and search icons directly from Visual Studio Code:
https://github.com/TOMIVERGARA/vscode-fontawesome-gallery

> This solution was created as the latest release of Font Awesome(v6) no longer includes a `metadata` folder, which contained useful information about the icons. This script aims to generate some of those missing files by getting the information from fontawesome's site.

NOTICE!
You should update the chromedriver accordingly.
